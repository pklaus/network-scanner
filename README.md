# Network Scanner

There is a very good tool to scan networks: it's called nmap.
This software uses nmap and the Python bindings python-nmap
to help you storing and analyzing results in a structured way
in a *shelve file*.

Requires Python3.3+ and python-nmap.

### Resources

* python-nmap, the library I'm using: <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-nmap>
* Shelve (for data persistance): <https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html>
